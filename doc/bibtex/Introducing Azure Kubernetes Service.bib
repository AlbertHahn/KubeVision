In many ways, container-based applications are what drove the need for container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes. As mentioned in the previous chapter, containers are instantiated from a read-only copy called an image. Images are often stored in a construct called a container registry.},

There are several shortcomings to the approach of using a single yaml file and kubectl for application deployment across multiple environments.
